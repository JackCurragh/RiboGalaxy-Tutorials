# Processing Ribo-Seq Data with RiboGalaxy for [RiboSeq.org](https://riboseq.org/)

## About RiboSeq.org

Riboseq.org is an online gateway to a set of integrated resources for the processing and analysis of ribosome profiling (Ribo-Seq) data. Currently these are GWIPS-viz, Trips-Viz and RiboGalaxy.  


**We recommend users process their Ribo-Seq data using RiboGalaxy and then upload their data to Trips-Viz for downstream analysis.**


[GWIPS-viz](https://gwips.ucc.ie) enables users to visualize Ribo-Seq and RNA-Seq data aligned to the genomes of 29 organisms along with auxiliary information such as reference annotations. Currently, pre-processed datasets from over 200 publicly available ribosome profiling studies are made available to users for visualization and download. GWIPS-Viz also supports the creation of user generated custom tracks for private data visualization. 

[Trips-Viz](https://trips.ucc.ie) enables visualization of public and private Ribo-Seq, RNA-seq and MassSpec data aligned to the transcriptomes2. It also enables a range of functionalities for the analysis of ribosome profiling data including footprints length distribution and periodicity, metagene profiles, differential expression, detection of translated ORFs and many more.

[RiboGalaxy](https://ribogalaxy.genomicsdatascience.ie/) is a Galaxy based platform tailored for the online processing of ribosome profiling data. The intuitive galaxy interface enables users who lack scripting skills or sufficient computational resources to process their data. A wide variety of reference sequences are supplied to streamline users' data processing workflows. RiboGalaxy simplifies Ribo-Seq data processing for upload to GWIPS-viz and Trips-Viz.
